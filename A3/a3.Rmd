Target: 

predict fast growth of firms 
2010-2015

Structure:

# PART I: Probability prediction
## Probability prediction
Predict probabilities
## Cross-validation
Look at cross-validated performance and pick your favorite model
# PART II: Classification
## Loss function
Think about the business problem, and define your loss function 
(like FP=X dollars, FN=Y dollars)
## Classification threshold
For each model, predict probabilities, look for the optimal 
classification threshold, calculate expected loss with your loss function. 
## Average exprected loss
Pick the model that has the smallest average (over 5 folds) expected loss
# PART III Discussion of results
## Confusion table 
Show a confusion table (on a selected fold or holdout set)
## Evaluation
Discuss results, evaluate how useful your model may be

Possible growth influencing factors:

Total sales: Companies with increasing sales are more likely to experience fast growth.

Income before tax: A higher income before tax can indicate a company's ability to reinvest in its business and support growth.

Shareholder equity: Higher shareholder equity can indicate a company's ability to raise funds to support growth.

Tangible assets: Companies with higher tangible assets may have the resources to invest in growth opportunities.

Inventories: Increasing inventories can indicate that a company is preparing for future sales growth.

Personnel expenditure: Companies that invest in their employees may have a more skilled and motivated workforce that can support fast growth.
