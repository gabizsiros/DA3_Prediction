Hi Reiner.

I am good thank you.

There has been a change, since December. Last week, BT received notification that its application for an EU License for technical assistance, has been rejected. So, not great news, and adds further weight to BT’s rundown exit plan from Russia. We are just unable to support our customer’s on multiple levels. 

BTs’ hard stop sell remains in place.
